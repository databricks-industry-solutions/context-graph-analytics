# MAGIC ## Use cases
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * An enterprise might have multiple IAM/SSO, AD domains, authn systems including local unix authn. An analyst investigating an incident will need to manually resolve these identities. Context graphs provide same_as edges that capture the results from any entity resolution package and these edges can be traversed like any other relationships.
# MAGIC * Attack Surface Analysis
# MAGIC     * Which user accounts have the largest footprint or surface within the given time frame?
# MAGIC     * Which IP addresses are shared by the largest number of users within the given time frame?
# MAGIC * Impact analysis (blast radius)
# MAGIC     * Given a compromised app, who are the users being affected?
# MAGIC     * Given two compromised user accounts, what if any is the relationship between them within the given time frame?
# MAGIC     * Given a compromiesd app/user/resource, what is the blast radius within the given time frame (use connected component analysis)?
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC ## Time filtering on time aggregated gold tables
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * The gold edges tables are aggregated into time buckets at possibly several granularities (hour, day, month etc)
# MAGIC * You typically want to query the gold table with the coarsest time granularity for the retention period your query is relevant for in order to get the best performance. For example if you want to query the data over the past 1 year, you should use the `v_edges_gold_month` (assuming you have constructed the monthly tables).
# MAGIC * Because each row in the gold tables corresponds to a time bucket
# MAGIC     * your query predicate needs to check for intersection with the query time window, AND
# MAGIC     * you might want to aggregate the results so that the edges are unique
# MAGIC     * this is demonstrated in the query below

# MAGIC ## Analysis using the `graphframes` package 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The next two analytics use case uses the graphframes package to perform Breadth First Search (BFS) and Connected Component (CC) analysis over large graph data sets. Note that connected component algorithm applies to undirected graphs and finds the components/subgraphs that are connected internally but not connected externally to the subgraph. The analogue for directed graphs is the notion of strongly connected components (SCC) where the nodes within a SCC are reachable to each other.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * BFS is used to determined if there is some path that connects to compromised user accounts. The paths (if any) represents possible pathways that an actor might have moved laterally.
# MAGIC * CC analysis is used to determine the partition/segmentation of the attack surface represented in the graph that represents the blast radius if any node in each component is compromised.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Given two compromised accounts, what if any is the relationship between them? (Uses the same_as edges)
