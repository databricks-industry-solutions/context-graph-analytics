# MAGIC ## Use cases
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * An enterprise might have multiple IAM/SSO, AD domains, authn systems including local unix authn. An analyst investigating an incident will need to manually resolve these identities. Context graphs provide `same_as` edges that capture the results from any entity resolution package and these edges can be traversed like any other relationships.
# MAGIC * Impact analysis (blast radius)
# MAGIC   * Given a compromised user account, what apps, ip addresses etc. has this account touched across the enterprise?
# MAGIC   * Given a compromised app or ip address, who are the users being affected?
# MAGIC * Investigate lateral movement as the attacker steals credentials, escalate privileges and move from one system to another (https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/lateral-movement/) 
# MAGIC * Investigate insider threat by exploring relationships with HR data sources

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ## Demo Setup
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You are an incident responder or an analyst investigating an advanced persistent threat. The following command simulates an investigation process that builds an investigation graph iteratively through a series of edge queries. You will build the investigation graph by changing the search parameter and executing the following command. To reset the investigation graph, you will need to execute the command prior to this cell.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The output of the following command consists of three components:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. The table of edges from the most recent search query
# MAGIC 2. The graph visualization
# MAGIC 3. The cumulative table of edges from the search history since the last reset.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ## Demo Story
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Suppose `maria.cole@chang-fisher.com` has been compromised. Let's pull back all the edges incident on that person.
# MAGIC     * You can hover over the edges or nodes in the graph visualization to see details.
# MAGIC     * It turns out that maria has an old account from a company Summers.info that the Chang-Fisher company has acquired.
# MAGIC     * Moreover, maria got married and changed her lastname.
# MAGIC     * Note all the IP addresses, apps, and resources that Maria has signed in from/to. 
# MAGIC     * This is an example of a `same_as` edge produced by an entity resolution package.
# MAGIC * Suppose we know from EDR alerts that `megan.chang@chang-fisher.com` is also compromised. Let's pull back her edges.
# MAGIC     * Observe that there are common IP addresses, apps and resources shared by the two compromised accounts. Any of these could be the pivot point the actor used to harvest these accounts and credentials.
# MAGIC * It is likely now that all the IP addresses Megan is associated with has been compromised. Let's expand on the IP address `165.225.221.4`.
# MAGIC     * Observe that Kyle Schultz also signs in from that IP address, so his account might be compromised too.
# MAGIC     * Let's pull back all edges that Kyle is associated with.
# MAGIC * Now let your imagination flow a bit and imagine how we can use graph algorithms like Breadth First Search and Strongly connected components to perform automated impact analysis.
